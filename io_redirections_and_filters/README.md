This project contains several shell scripts designed to practice fundamental shell scripting concepts such as input/output redirection, text filtering, and processing files using standard Linux command-line utilities.

The scripts demonstrate how to:

Read input from files or standard input

Redirect output to files or the console

Use filters like grep, cut, sort, uniq, tr, and tail

Process and manipulate text data efficiently
